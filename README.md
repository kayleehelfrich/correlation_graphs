The code files in this folder are examples of correlation graphs and analyses I used to define the relationship between 2 variables. 
The files include how I imported and modified the data, and how I created a publication-quality graph using ggplot2.

One example includes relating maternal kidney and fetal liver erythropoietin expression. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells.
Another example is relating fetal liver hepcidin expression and fetal body weight to assess their relationship.

The code is relatively simple and can be easily adapted to other uses.
